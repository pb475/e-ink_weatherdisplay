I have also created a script to auto-convert the png files to bmp.
Generally for the e-ink screen .bmp files are preferred due to aliasing and some funky things with re-scaling bmp files.

To run, just do:
`python3 png2bmp_converter.py`

It should read all png directories and create some bmp files.
